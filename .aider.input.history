+Videx – Mini Video-Sharing App Development Plan
+1. Project Overview
+
+Videx is a lightweight video-sharing application that allows users to upload, watch, like, and share short videos. The app focuses on simplicity, speed, and a clean user experience.
+
+2. Core Features
+MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
+
+User Registration & Login
+
+Email/password or social login (Google/Apple).
+
+Video Upload
+
+Upload short videos (up to 60 seconds).
+
+Basic compression and format validation.
+
+Video Feed
+
+Infinite scroll feed of videos.
+
+Auto-play on scroll.
+
+User Interactions
+
+Like, comment, share.
+
+User Profiles
+
+Profile photo, username, uploaded videos.
+
+Search
+
+Search by username or tags.
+
+Basic Notifications
+
+New likes or comments.
+
+Future Enhancements
+
+Video editing tools (trim, filters, music).
+
+Live streaming.
+
+Private messaging.
+
+AI-generated recommendations.
+
+3. Tech Stack
+Frontend
+
+React Native or Flutter for mobile app
+
+UI library: React Native Paper, Tailwind, or Material UI
+
+Backend
+
+Node.js + Express or NestJS
+
+REST API or GraphQL
+
+Database
+
+MongoDB or PostgreSQL
+
+Storage
+
+Cloud storage for videos: AWS S3, Firebase Storage, or Cloudflare R2
+
+Authentication
+
+Firebase Auth or Auth0
+
+Deployment
+
+Backend: AWS / Vercel / Render
+
+Mobile app: Google Play & App Store
+
+4. System Architecture (High-Level)
+
+Mobile App sends requests to the backend API.
+
+Backend API handles:
+
+authentication
+
+video metadata
+
+likes/comments
+
+Cloud Storage stores the video files themselves.
+
+CDN accelerates video delivery.
+
+Database stores user data, video metadata, interactions.
+
+5. Development Phases
+Phase 1 – Planning
+
+Define requirements & use cases.
+
+Create wireframes and UI mockups.
+
+Approve architecture.
+
+Phase 2 – Backend Development
+
+Create API structure.
+
+Implement registration/login.
+
+Add video upload endpoint.
+
+Integrate cloud storage.
+
+Phase 3 – Frontend Development
+
+Build navigation.
+
+Create login screen.
+
+Create video upload UI.
+
+Create home feed.
+
+Add profile screens.
+
+Phase 4 – Integration
+
+Connect frontend with backend API.
+
+Test upload, playback, interactions.
+
+Phase 5 – Testing
+
+Unit tests.
+
+Performance tests (especially video streaming).
+
+Bug fixing.
+
+Phase 6 – Launch
+
+Publish on app stores.
+
+Prepare marketing assets.
+
+Monitor app performance.
+
+6. Monetization Options
+
+In-app ads (rewarded or interstitial).
+
+Premium subscription (no ads, extra features).
+
+Paid filters/effects.
+
+Brand partnerships.
+
+7. Success Metrics (KPIs)
+
+Daily/Monthly Active Users.
+
+Number of uploaded videos.
+
+Engagement (likes, comments).
+
+Average watch time.
+
+Retention rate (Day 1 / Day 7 / Day 30).
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
